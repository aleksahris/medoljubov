<p>I am a small apricot poodle. When I was a puppy, I was very naughty. I loved to play with the socks of my Mom and Dad just to get their attention. Now I am two and a half years old and my Mom trained me well. I know a lot of tricks such as "Sit", "Lay down", "Come", "Kiss" and other.</p>

<p>I love to play with my toys and show them to My Mom and Dad's friends when they come to visit. My favorite toy is ball (I have 4 of them!). Also, I love to cuddle and when I'm sleepy if you say "Medo let's cuddle!", I will immediately jump into your lap :)</p>

<p>I do not eat a lot, but I am very curious and I love to try new dishes. The last thing I'm crazy about is Balkan sauce called "Ajvar". <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajvar" target="_blank">Ajvar</a> is a thick sauce made of red peper. It's very popular here in Macedonia.</p>

<p>I am very playful. I have a lot of dog-friends, Tobi, Mark, Kala, Leo, Leks, Sara and my girlfriend Masha :) I love kids and children adore me. I am an amazing dog and my Mom and Dad are lucky to have me!</p>
